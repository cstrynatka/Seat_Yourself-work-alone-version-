# Seat_Yourself-work-alone-version-

This was a class project where we imitated the concept of Open Table, a web app that allows users to make restaurant reservations online.

There were four of us working on this project, with my main responsibility coming in the beginning stages where I constructed the mockup and rough outline of the app. 

After that, the rest of us collaborated on improving the MVP with this repo's author in charge of the final edits.
